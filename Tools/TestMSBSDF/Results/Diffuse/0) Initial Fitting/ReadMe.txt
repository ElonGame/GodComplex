This is the folder containing the fitted values for the whole model, without any matching
We first matched the lobe flattening function as it seemed simple enough and also because both scale and flattening seemed corelated,
 we then proceeded to remove the flattening from the list of free parameters and use its analytical expression instead...

This should result in more stable parameters...
