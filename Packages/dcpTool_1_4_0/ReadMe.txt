The binary executables:

The binary executables are the only things that most people will ever need to know about:

The binaries can be found in the "Binaries" subdirectory, in either the "Windows" or 
"OS X" directories.

The OS X version of dcpTool is entirely self contained, but in order to run the Windows 
version, you must have the supplied dlls (iconv.dll, libxl2.dll and zlib1.dll) in the same 
directory as the dcpTool.exe file

Usage is documented in the documentation directory (open the index.html 
file) or the website: http://dcpTool.sourceforge.com.

Notes for compliling the source:

1. This was built under VC Express 2008 for Windows, and XCode 3 for the Mac. The respective 
project files are included

2. In order to compile dcpTool, you need to download the Adobe DNG SDK 1.3, and compile it

3. In order to recompile the DNG SDK, you will need to:

a) Download the Adobe XMP SDK, as well as the approporiate version of Expat, zlib, MD5 and QTDevWin. 
How to include these into the XMP SDK is documented by Adobe on www.adobe.com, and in the XMP SDK

b) You will need to modify the DNG SDK if you want the ability to extract profiles from DNG files.
The diff files to do this is provided in the dng_sdk/source directory

More information on compiling is in the documentation directory (open the index.html 
file) or the website: http://dcpTool.sourceforge.com.
